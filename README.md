Workflows are systems where LLM's will go throught the predefined code paths
AI Agent  are the systems where the LLM;s dynamically make decisions and take actions on its own to achieve a goal without being explicitly told what to do at every step
-> Goal oriented planning
-> Multi step reasoning
-> taking decisions
-> using tools, knowledge

if we give full control, then reliability decreases
So langgraph helps in increasing the reliability.

Some other examples - ACNO, Google ADK

Langgraph is a graph based stateful orchestration
